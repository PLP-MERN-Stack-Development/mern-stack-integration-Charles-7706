# How It Works (For the Learner)

You are the learner building and running this MERN stack blog app. Here’s what you do:

- Open the app to see a list of blog posts (these come from your backend database)
- Click 'Add Post' to open a form
- Fill in the title and content, then submit
- Your new post is saved and instantly appears in the list

**What’s happening:**
- The React frontend talks to your Node/Express backend
- The backend saves and fetches posts from MongoDB
- Everything updates automatically when you add a post

This helps you practice full-stack integration: React (frontend), Express/Node (backend), and MongoDB (database).
